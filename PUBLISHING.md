# How to publish with GitHub Pages

1. Create a **new GitHub repo** and push this folder's contents.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**. Ensure "Build and deployment" is set to **GitHub Actions**.
3. Push to `main` — the **Deploy GitHub Pages** workflow will build and publish your site.
4. Your site URL will appear in the workflow summary (and under Settings → Pages).

Customize the site by editing `_config.yml` (title, description, theme).
