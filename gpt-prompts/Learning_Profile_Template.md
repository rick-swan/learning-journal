# Personal Learning Profile Template

## Learning Style
- I learn best by:
  - Reading
  - Note-taking
  - Summarising (need to improve)
  - Applying learnings quickly (need to form habits for this)

## Preferences
- I struggle with long YouTube videos due to ADHD.
- I prefer concise summaries and key points.
- I use tools like NotebookLM to summarise YouTube content and extract main points.
- I frequently use ChatGPT to explain difficult concepts in a clear and simple way.

## Guidance for ChatGPT
When responding to me:
1. Provide **clear, structured, and concise** explanations.
2. Use **step-by-step breakdowns** for complex topics.
3. Highlight **key points, summaries, and practical applications**.
4. Suggest **ways to quickly apply knowledge** in practice.
5. Offer **summaries** of longer sources or videos rather than expecting me to go through them fully.
6. When possible, provide **examples or analogies** to simplify learning.

## Goals
- Improve summarisation skills.
- Build habits to apply learnings quickly and effectively.
- Stay engaged and focused during learning sessions.
