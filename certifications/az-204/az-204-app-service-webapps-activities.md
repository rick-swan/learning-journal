# AZ-204 â€“ App Service Web Apps: Practical Activities

This file lists **hands-on activities** you can perform with your **existing projects** (blog project, AZ-204 sample test apps, etc.) to apply App Service learnings in practice.

---

## 1. App Service Basics
- âœ… Deploy your blog app to **Azure App Service** using `az webapp up`.
- âœ… Experiment with both **Linux** and **Windows** runtimes.
- âœ… Check available Linux runtimes via:
  ```bash
  az webapp list-runtimes --os-type linux
  ```

---

## 2. App Service Plans
- âœ… Deploy your blog app into a **Free plan**, then upgrade to **Standard** and test scaling.
- âœ… Create **two different App Service Plans** (Standard and Premium) and deploy sample apps to compare cost/features.
- âœ… Practice **when to isolate an app** into a new plan (e.g., resource-heavy vs. lightweight).

---

## 3. Deployment Methods
- âœ… Set up **GitHub Actions** for your blog project to auto-deploy on push.
- âœ… Try a **manual deployment** using:
  - Git push to deployment URL
  - FTP upload
  - Zip deploy (`az webapp deployment source config-zip`)
- âœ… Deploy your AZ-204 test app using a **staging slot**, then **swap slots** with production.

---

## 4. Containers & Sidecars
- âœ… Containerize your blog app and push it to **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**.
- âœ… Deploy the container from ACR to App Service.
- âœ… Add a **sidecar container** (e.g., monitoring/logging service) alongside your app.

---

## 5. Authentication & Authorization
- âœ… Enable **Microsoft Entra ID authentication** on your blog project.
- âœ… Configure **unauthenticated requests allowed** vs **login required** modes.
- âœ… Inspect tokens in the **App Service token store** using environment variables.
- âœ… Add logging and check how **auth traces** appear in logs.

---

## 6. Networking
- âœ… Retrieve **outbound IP addresses** of your blog app and whitelist them in a test API or DB firewall:
  ```bash
  az webapp show --resource-group <rg> --name <app> --query outboundIpAddresses --output tsv
  ```
- âœ… Compare **multitenant vs. isolated (ASE)** by reading documentation and designing when each fits your projects.
- âœ… Restrict inbound traffic to your blog app using **Access Restrictions (IP rules)**.

---

## 7. Integration Scenarios
- âœ… Connect your blog app to an external **Azure SQL DB** and test firewall rules.
- âœ… Use **Key Vault references** in your appâ€™s settings (e.g., store DB connection string).
- âœ… Enable **Application Insights** to trace and log app requests.

---

## 8. Stretch Goals
- ðŸš€ Deploy your **AZ-204 sample app** into multiple slots (dev, staging, prod) and practice swapping.
- ðŸš€ Scale your blog app using **autoscaling rules** (CPU/memory thresholds).
- ðŸš€ Experiment with **zero-downtime deployments** using deployment slots + GitHub Actions.

---

âœ… By completing these activities, youâ€™ll bridge the gap between **exam theory** and **real-world implementation**.
